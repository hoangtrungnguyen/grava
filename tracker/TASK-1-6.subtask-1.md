status: todo
Description: Implement ephemeral flag handling for Wisps.
---

## User Story
**As a** system
**I want to** mark issues as ephemeral
**So that** they can be easily cleaned up later

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `create` command supports `--ephemeral` flag
- [ ] Queries exclude ephemeral items by default
